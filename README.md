# TicTacToe
A basic ASCII TicTacToe game. This game is intended to be run through a bash terminal. The functions are kept in one file, the initialization in another (the .hpp file), and the main function in a third file.
Simply run the ttt.cpp file using the functions from tttFunc.cpp and it should output a file you can use to run the game.
The game currently does not keep score or allow for multiple games (03/09/2023 10:01) but I am working to include that.
The game iterates 9 times and then displays the final board for you and a friend to keep tally yourselves. If you would like to play again, run it again!
Otherwise, have fun!
