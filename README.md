# TicTacToe
A basic ASCII TicTacToe game. This game is intended to be run through a bash terminal. The functions are kept in one file, the initialization in another (the .hpp file), and the main function in a third file.
Simply run the ttt.cpp file using the functions from tttFunc.cpp and it should output a file you can use to run the game.
The game currently does not keep score or allow for multiple games (03/09/2023 10:01) but I am working to include that.
The game iterates 9 times and then displays the final board for you and a friend to keep tally yourselves. If you would like to play again, run it again!
Otherwise, have fun!

UPDATE (03/13/2023)
This game has been updated to ask and accept user input of whether the user would like to play another game. The game keeps score and displays the winner and score when the last game is play and the users decide to exit.
